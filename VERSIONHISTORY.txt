	-Returns error messages when receiving incompatible inputs
-Added code to compare the rice rolled to the comparative value
	-Outputs probability that chosen roll will equal or exceed the comparative value
	-Outputs the minimum value, maximum value, and mean value from the simulation
	-Tested Windows Narrator against output in Jupyter Notebook environment
